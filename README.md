## 2015: A Day with my Music

  David Mellinger woke up abruptly to the beeping of a truck backing up outside of his window. He rolled over to check the time and saw that it was 7:30 am September 2nd, 2015; a perfect day to start his new job. He grabs his phone and checks social media for about 15 minutes before deciding to get up. He asks Alexa on his phone to set a timer so he knows when he has to leave for work, and then goes to get ready in his bathroom. David knows that starting his mornings off right means always listening to an upbeat tune as he gets ready. He bends over and plugs in his boombox cd player then without missing a beat rifles through all the cd cases until he spies his favorite Eminem cd. Popping it in the open mouth of the box, David smiled at the satisfying snap as it closed. Pushing the play button the boombox sprang to life roaring a magnificent roar as David danced around brushing his teeth and putting his clothes on.

  On the way to his new job David hopped onto the city bus and took a seat. Shuffling through his phone hoping not to make eye contact with anyone he hoped he still had enough data left to get him through the ride as nothing else was very entertaining. After scrolling through Facebook for the tenth time he decided to put his phone away and look around to enjoy the ride. A lady in the back was talking on the phone loudly and he cringed as he could almost hear both sides of the conversation. He saw other morning riders shift around uneasily as if they did not know where to cast their gaze. Several were taking naps, and a handful more were reading books or a newspaper, to which David rolled his eyes because who reads the newspaper for news anymore? He wished he could bring his boombox on the bus or could afford a Walkman which these days cost just as much as a good phone, but then he would have to carry multiple devices and that was just too much hassle. Instead he closed his eyes and imagined a happy melody to slowly soothe him while he travelled.

  Bleary eyed and half awake after a full successful first day at his job, David unenthusiastically opens the door to his least favorite place...the gym. Dreading his workout all day but knowing it's for his own good, David just hopes the gym is playing good music today, wishing that he could just play his own. Wandering over to the weights section he sighs hearing the track the gym is playing start skipping and thinking about how he would never let his precious cds be manhandled and scratched like the gyms beat up discs. A couple of muscular gym guys walked past scoffing at him as they adjusted their uncomfortable looking headphones with their walkmans strapped to them and their packs of cds under their arm so they could change an artist at a moment's notice. Feeling defeated and tired David headed out watching the social media queens take selfies for their instagrams with their new walkmans in the long gym mirrors knowing they would have a thousand likes accumulated easily within a couple minutes.

  Back home he orders food from Ubereats and washes his laundry while he waits for it to arrive. Before going to sleep David puts on his favorite Adele cd, switching the boombox from where it was plugged in the bathroom this morning to his bedroom and wiping down the cd before he puts it in to make sure there are no dust or scratches. He drifts off into dreamland, ready for another day of work tomorrow. 


## Micro Essay

In my story, the idea is that in a modern society, if iPods or music platforms were never invented the world could still function as normal with small changes regarding how we enjoy music, this makes sense because even in the 1800’s people were still able to enjoy music, it is just the media in which we enjoy it through that has changed and transformed. When David is going through normal everyday activities we see small changes where having old media work as new media is different. This is an instance of zombie media as music has just transformed into new media and found news ways to be listened to through new inventions and technology, but the premise of what music is, is still the same in its essence. Bruce Sterling said “a lot of dead media were actually zombie media: living dead that found an afterlife in new contexts, new hands, new screens and machines. My story shows how cd players and walkmans are zombie media as we have essentially just re-invented them into iPods and different forms of music players, not invented something completely new. This story invites critical thought about the past, present and future by demonstrating how old media can work in place of new media in a “new media” world.
